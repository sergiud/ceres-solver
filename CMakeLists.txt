  DESCRIPTION "A Large Scale Non-linear Optimization Library"
)

# NOTE: The following CMake variables must be applied consistently to all
# targets in project to avoid visibility warnings by placing the variables at
# the project top.

# Always build position-independent code (PIC), even when building Ceres as a
# static library so that shared libraries can link against it, not just
# executables (PIC does not apply on Windows). Global variable can be overridden
# by the user whereas target properties can be not.
set(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)
# Set the default symbol visibility to hidden to unify the behavior among
# the various compilers and to get smaller binaries
set(CMAKE_C_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden)
set(CMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden)
set(CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN ON)

# NOTE: The 'generic' CMake variables CMAKE_[SOURCE/BINARY]_DIR should not be
#       used.  Always use the project-specific variants (generated by CMake):
#       <PROJECT_NAME_MATCHING_CASE>_[SOURCE/BINARY]_DIR, e.g.
#       Ceres_SOURCE_DIR (note, *not* CERES_SOURCE_DIR) instead, as these will
#       always point to the correct directories for the Ceres project, even if
#       it is nested inside another source tree, whereas the 'generic'
#       CMake variables refer to the *first* project() declaration, i.e. the
#       top-level project, not Ceres, if Ceres is nested.

# Make CMake aware of the cmake folder for local FindXXX scripts,
# append rather than set in case the user has passed their own
# additional paths via -D.

# Ceres supports two mechanisms by which it can be detected & imported into
# client code which uses CMake via find_package(Ceres):
#
#   1) Installation (e.g. to /usr/local), using CMake's install() function.
#
#   2) (Optional) Export of the current build directory into the local CMake
#      package registry, using CMake's export() function.  This allows use of
#      Ceres from other projects without requiring installation.
#
# In both cases, we need to generate a configured CeresConfig.cmake which
# includes additional autogenerated files which in concert create an imported
# target for Ceres in a client project when find_package(Ceres) is invoked.
# The key distinctions are where this file is located, and whether client code
# references installed copies of the compiled Ceres headers/libraries,
# (option #1: installation), or the originals in the source/build directories
# (option #2: export of build directory).
#
# NOTE: If Ceres is both exported and installed, provided that the installation
#       path is present in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH when find_package(Ceres) is called,
#       the installed version is preferred.
